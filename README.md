The shared dataset is sampled from the 0.7 billion dataset used in the paper.

## Description:

The datasets are used in "Deep Multifaceted Transformers for Multi-objective Ranking in Large-Scale E-commerce Recommender Systems", which is published in CIKM 2020.



In this paper, the two tasks are click prediction and order prediction.

The goal of click prediction is to predict the CTR.

The goal of order prediction is to predict the CTVR = CTR * CVR, which aims to eliminate the sample bias problem in CVR task [1] .

CTR: Click-Through Rate, CVR: ConVersion Rate.

| **Type**   | **Click** **prediction** **(CTR)** | **Order** **prediction** **(CTVR)** |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Impression | 0                                  | 0                                   |
| Click      | 1                                  | 0                                   |
| Order      | 1                                  | 1                                   |

## Research Topics:

This dataset can be used for research on CTR prediction, CVR prediction, multi-task ranking, sequential modeling, unbiased ranking in Recommender Systems. This dataset should only be used for research purpose!

## File Description:

The dataset files are in the format of TFRecord.

Each line in the TFRecord files contains the ranking features and label in the Recommender System.



The ranking features contains 615 dense features and some id features.

The labels are impressions (labels=0), clicks (labels=1 or 2) and orders (labels=4 or 5).

| feature type         | name                  | desc                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dense features       | features              | 615 dimension dense features. They contain item profile features (e.g.,number of clicks, CTR, CVR, rating) , use profile features (e.g.,prefered categories and brands, purchase power), user-item matching features (e.g.,whether the item matches the userâ€™s gender or age) and user-item interaction features (e.g.,number of clicks on thecategory of the item within a time window). |
